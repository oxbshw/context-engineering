# Context Engineering: From Zero to Hero

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to context engineering techniques for large language models (LLMs). The goal is to help users progress from basic prompt design to advanced context management patterns.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Basic Prompt Design**: Starting with fundamental prompt engineering principles
2. **Context Expansion**: Techniques for expanding simple prompts into rich contexts
3. **Control Loops**: Implementing structured reasoning with loops and conditionals
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrating external knowledge with LLM responses
5. **Prompt Programs**: Treating prompts as executable programs with state and operations
6. **Schema Design**: Creating structured schemas for consistent and verifiable LLM interactions
7. **Recursive Patterns**: Implementing self-improving contexts through recursive techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)
- Basic understanding of LLM interactions

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Each notebook is designed to be run sequentially to build understanding progressively:

```bash
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 01_basic_prompts.ipynb
%run 02_context_expansion.ipynb
%run 03_control_loops.ipynb
%run 04_rag_recipes.ipynb
%run 05_prompt_programs.ipynb
%run 06_schema_design.ipynb
%run 07_recursive_patterns.ipynb
```
