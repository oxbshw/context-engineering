# 📘 Overview: What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the art and science of crafting, managing, and analyzing the input that we feed into large language models (LLMs).

Rather than simply "prompting" a model, context engineering focuses on the full structure and semantics of the input — from token budget and information ordering to retrieval strategies and context compression.

## Why It Matters

LLMs don't "think" — they statistically predict text based on what they've seen. So the quality, clarity, and construction of the context you provide directly affects output quality.

With better context engineering, you can:

* Improve factual accuracy
* Control style and tone
* Inject custom knowledge
* Reduce hallucinations

## Key Capabilities in This Toolkit

* 🧠 **Prompt Design**: Test and iterate different instructions or templates
* 🔍 **Token Inspection**: See exactly how prompts are broken into tokens
* 📚 **Context Assembly**: Simulate RAG workflows to test document retrieval and compression
* 🎛 **Budget Management**: Track and manage token usage in real time

## Who Should Use This?

This project is built for:

* AI researchers and engineers
* Prompt engineers and technical writers
* Developers integrating LLMs into apps
* Anyone who wants to understand how models “see” text
