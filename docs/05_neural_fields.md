# 🧬 Neural Fields: An Experimental Frontier

This project optionally explores **neural fields** — a modern approach to compressing and representing large volumes of text for more efficient context injection.

While traditional retrieval methods use discrete chunking + embeddings, neural fields treat information more continuously and abstractly.

## 🌐 What Are Neural Fields?

Neural fields (sometimes called Neural Representations or Neural Scene Representations) are models that learn to map spatial or semantic coordinates to high-dimensional data.

Originally developed for 3D rendering (e.g., NeRF), they are now being applied to text and memory.

## 🧠 Why Use Neural Fields for Text?

* Compress large documents into dense, learnable representations
* Enable semantic interpolation between ideas
* Potentially reduce token overhead for context injection

Example: Instead of injecting full documents into context, you encode them into a continuous latent space and decode only what’s needed.

## 🧪 Research Inspirations

This module is **experimental** and inspired by:

* [Neural Text Fields (NTF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07753)
* [Memory in Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17851)
* [Semantic Compression for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02230)

## 🛠 Status in This Project

The code includes placeholder hooks for neural field support:

* Dense memory prototypes
* Latent coordinate mapping (experimental)

They are disabled by default but provide a basis for further research or extensions.

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This section is intended for advanced users and researchers. Neural fields in NLP are evolving rapidly, and many ideas are still exploratory.
